# fAITOWN
My second website I made in late 2017 to master my skills in php, sql and zurb foundation

I love this website. I made it entirely for myself/ I wanted something plain and understandable, something in the mean time cool. 
I would really love to mantain this website and one day I will expand it, but till that day comes - he definetely deserves to be here
around my other projects and etc.
